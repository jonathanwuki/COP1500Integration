Integration project for COP 1500 at Florida Gulf Coast University (Spring 2021)

For this project, we were to create one program integrating all of the programming skills we learned throughout the semester. I created a basic command-based application which mainly serves as a calculator but also contains other miscellaneous features.

## Project Requirements

### Sprint 1
- [x] Proper documentation
- [x] Simple I/O (`print()` function with `end=` and `sep=` arguments), `input()` function)
- [x] Basic calculations (addition, subtraction, etc.)
- [x] String operators
- [x] Min. 50 lines of code

### Sprint 2
- [x] Shortcut operators
- [x] Conditional structures/statements
- [x] Relational and boolean operators
- [x] Iterative structures (`while`, `for`, `range()`, `in`)
- [x] Function definitions and parameter passing
- [x] Min. 100 lines of code

### Project Final
- [x] Enhance code quality/security (no warnings from PyCharm with PEP 8 style guide)
- [x] All functions must have docstrings/proper commentation
- [x] Consider HCI and improve user interface
- [x] Must act as one cohesive program
- [x] Min. 150 lines of code

## Installation/Building
In order to build this project, you need to have Python 3 or later. I used PyCharm for compliation, but any IDE or interpreter should work.

#### Instructions:

Clone a copy of this git repository by running:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/jonathanwuki/COP1500Integration.git
```

Open `main.py` and compile (exact instructions vary by IDE/interpreter).
